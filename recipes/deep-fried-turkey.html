    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ½ gallons peanut oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large stockpot or turkey fryer to 350 degrees F (175
        <br />
        degrees C). Make sure the fryer is located outdoors in a safe area,
        <br />
        preferably on dirt or pavement, and far away from buildings, wooden
        <br />
        decks, or other objects. Keep a fire extinguisher handy, just in case.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that the turkey is completely thawed. Cut any extra skin away
        <br />
        from the neck area and make sure neck hole is at least 1 inch in
        <br />
        diameter. Pat the bird completely dry with paper towels, then rub
        <br />
        liberally with salt and pepper on both the outside and the inside.
        <br />
        Place turkey into a drain basket, neck-side first.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working slowly and carefully, gently lower the basket into the hot oil
        <br />
        to completely cover the turkey. Maintain the temperature of the oil at
        <br />
        350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per
        <br />
        pound, about 35 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat
        <br />
        thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; the internal
        <br />
        temperature must be 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Allow to rest for 15
        <br />
        minutes before slicing.
      </li>
    </ol>
